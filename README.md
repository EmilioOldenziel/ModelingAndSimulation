Code can be executed by the following command: 

 single_intersection(rounds, green_mode, lock_mode)
 
 with arguments:
 
 -rounds: amount of iterations
 
 -green_mode: how the control of traffic lights is set: 1 gives monitored mode, 0 gives Round Robin
 
 -lock_mode: how long the traffic_light will be on green: 1 green till all cars in queue are gone, 0 for 1 iteration
